## Education

- **Doctorate in experimental physical chemistry** (DPhil) at the University of Oxford, Timmel Group.\
    Developed a novel data analysis methodology for the stimulus-modulated derivative spectroscopy. Built and programmed a broadband cavity-enhanced absorption spectrometer. Characterised the effects of the magnetic field on the photoinduced absorption dynamics of recombinant wildtype and mutant cryptochrome proteins. Programmed the data analysis protocols and developed the analysis pipelines to measure the spatiotemporally resolved magnetic field effects using fluorescence scanning microscopy. Thesis available [here](/publication/2020-04-30-thesis).
- **Masters in Chemistry** (MChem, high 2.1) at the University of Oxford, Somerville College.\
    Developed, built and programmed a modulated fluorescence experiment during the final-year project.
- **A-Levels** at Hurstpierpoint College\
    4A*, 3A in Math, Extended Math, Chemistry, Biology, Physics, Polish, Extended project.
