excerpt: "We've expressed cryptochrome 4 proteins from the eyes of a night-migratory songbirds; European robins. We've shown that, under photoillumination, they form radical pairs and exhibit photodetected magnetosensitivity (my contribution) which is consistent with the radical-pair model of magnetoreception."

## Abstract

Night-migratory songbirds are remarkably proficient navigators. Flying alone and often over great distances, they use various directional cues including, crucially, a light-dependent magnetic compass. The mechanism of this compass has been suggested to rely on the quantum spin dynamics of photoinduced radical pairs in cryptochrome flavoproteins located in the retinas of the birds. Here we show that the photochemistry of cryptochrome 4 (CRY4) from the night-migratory European robin (_Erithacus rubecula_) is magnetically sensitive in vitro, and more so than CRY4 from two non-migratory bird species, chicken (_Gallus gallus_) and pigeon (_Columba livia_). Site-specific mutations of *Er*CRY4 reveal the roles of four successive flavin–tryptophan radical pairs in generating magnetic field effects and in stabilizing potential signalling states in a way that could enable sensing and signalling functions to be independently optimized in night-migratory birds.
