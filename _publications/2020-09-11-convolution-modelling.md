## Abstract

Dataset containing the supplementary data to ["Development of lock-in based overtone Modulated MARY spectroscopy for detection of weak magnetic field effects"](/publication/2020-12-23-overtone-modmary), as well as demonstration and data analysis scripts. The analysis requires Matlab (developed on R2017b, not tested on any other version). The scripts depend only on vanilla Matlab -- no additional toolboxes are required.
