excerpt: "I've written a meta-language to help with writing programs in an esolang called Pyramid Scheme. In this publication I describe the details if this language and give a few examples of its use; I write an linear congruential random number generator and a bubble-sort algorithm in Pyramid Scheme."

## Abstract

In this work we present a metalanguage which allows simpler writing of Pyramid Scheme programs. We first introduce the Pyramid Scheme itself, pointing out some more interesting features. We then proceed to define a base lisp-like notation for Pyramid Scheme (called psll), and expand on it with local macros (and semi-local) macro expansions which allow for higher-level constructs. Notably, we introduce strings, arrays and preprocessor definitions which can be used akin to functions.

This publication is intended as an elaborate joke which, nevertheless, contains a healthy dose of quite real and elaborate programming effort.
